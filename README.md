Dev Relay github round complete. We turned half remembered UI instructions into woking site, somehow didn't break the main branch. This repo is the final proof of team work + deadline equals to productivity.

This project is a Stranger Things–themed login interface inspired by the dark, cinematic atmosphere of the series. The website features a custom-designed login page with animated lights, blended background visuals, and character imagery to create a unified, immersive experience. After entering user credentials, the interface redirects to a dedicated alert page, simulating an Upside Down–style emergency dashboard.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on visual storytelling, smooth user interaction, and modern UI design principles.
